phpdocr is a simple way to access PHP documentation from php.net from the
command-line.

It will download, prettify, and output PHP documentation for the
function/class/.. that was supplied on the command-line, much like perldoc(1)
does for perl(1) and ri does for ruby(1). Unless you explicitly tell it not to,
phpdocr will also cache the documentation locally for fast retrieval in the
future.

phpdocr will send its output to your PAGER (if it is set, otherwise it will
default to less).
