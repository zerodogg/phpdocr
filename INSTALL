Installation instructions for phpdocr
---------------------------------------

In order to install phpdocr simply run the following command:
	make install
in the phpdocr directory.  You can do this as your user to install it locally
for a single user, or as root to install it globally for all users.

You will also need to install phpdocr's dependencies. Outside of a normal ruby
installation, it needs the 'mechanize' rubygem. It can be obtained through
'gem' by issuing "gem install mechanize" - it is also available through many
distributions packaging systems (ie. rubygem-mechanize on Fedora and
libwww-mechanize-ruby on Ubuntu). Finally you will need to have one of the
following programs installed: elinks, links2, links, w3m, html2text, lynx.
