# Yes this is a pod file living in a Ruby project.
#
# POD is a very nice format to write documentation in, and RDoc does
# not appear to be able to properly export to manpages, hence why I
# decided to use POD. The manpage that also lives in the git repo
# is the one that is distributed. The POD only lives in the git repo
# and is used to generate the manpage.

=head1 NAME

phpdocr - a simple way to access PHP documentation from the command-line

=head1 SYNOPSIS

phpdocr I<[OPTIONS]> I<[FUNCTION/CLASS/SEARCH STRING/..]>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<phpdocr> is a simple way to access PHP documentation from php.net
from the command-line.

It will download, prettify, and output PHP documentation for the
function/class/.. that was supplied on the command-line, much like
perldoc(1) does for perl(1) and ri does for ruby(1).

phpdocr will send its output to your PAGER (if it is set, otherwise
it will default to less).

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-h, --help>

Display the help screen

=item B<-v, --verbose>

Increase verbosity. When this is present phpdocr will tell you additional
information about what it is doing, ie. what page it is downloading at the
moment.

=item B<-c, --comments>

php.net has comments associated with most pages. By default phpdocr will
filter these away, however some times you may want to see them, in that
case supply --comments and phpdocr will include them in its output.

=item B<--man>

Show the manpage. Normally 'man phpdocr' would do, but when phpdocr is
installed from a rubygem the phpdocr manpage isn't placed anywhere
in man(1)'s path, this will autodetect its location and issue man
directly on the phpdocr.1 file (and thus work even when 'man phpdocr'
does not).
