.SH "NAME"
phpdocr \- a simple way to access PHP documentation from the command\-line
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
phpdocr \fI[\s-1OPTIONS\s0]\fR \fI[\s-1FUNCTION/CLASS/SEARCH\s0 \s-1STRING/\s0..]\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBphpdocr\fR is a simple way to access \s-1PHP\s0 documentation from php.net
from the command-line.
.PP
It will download, prettify, and output \s-1PHP\s0 documentation for the
function/class/.. that was supplied on the command-line, much like
\&\fIperldoc\fR\|(1) does for \fIperl\fR\|(1) and ri does for \fIruby\fR\|(1).
.PP
phpdocr will send its output to your \s-1PAGER\s0 (if it is set, otherwise
it will default to less).
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-h, \-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h, --help"
Display the help screen
.IP "\fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fR" 4
.IX Item "-v, --verbose"
Increase verbosity. When this is present phpdocr will tell you additional
information about what it is doing, ie. what page it is downloading at the
moment.
.IP "\fB\-o, \-\-comments\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o, --comments"
php.net has comments associated with most pages. By default phpdocr will
filter these away, however some times you may want to see them, in that
case supply \-\-comments and phpdocr will include them in its output.
.IP "\fB\-n, \-\-no\-cache\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n, --no-cache"
By default, phpdocr will cache documentation locally so that it can
easily be retrieved later without having to re-download it. This
parameter disables all caching (both reading from the cache, and
writing to the cache).
.IP "\fB\-m, \-\-mirror\fR \fI\s-1PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m, --mirror PATH"
By default phpdocr will connect to php.net. Use this to make it connect
to a specific mirror instead (ie. no2.php.net).
.IP "\fB\-\-man\fR" 4
.IX Item "--man"
Show the manpage. Normally 'man phpdocr' would do, but when phpdocr is
installed from a rubygem the phpdocr manpage isn't placed anywhere
in \fIman\fR\|(1)'s path, this will autodetect its location and issue man
directly on the phpdocr.1 file (and thus work even when 'man phpdocr'
does not).
.SH "FILES"
.IX Header "FILES"
\&\fI~/.phpdocr\fR \- this is where phpdocr will store any cached documentation.
It is safe to remove this directory, or any of its contents, at any time
if you need the disk space. phpdocr will simply re-download the documentation
next time you request it.
.SH "DEPENDENCIES"
.IX Header "DEPENDENCIES"
Requires one of: elinks, links2, links, html2text or lynx for \s-1HTML\s0 parsing.
.PP
Requires the mechanize rubygem for fetching stuff over \s-1HTTP\s0.
